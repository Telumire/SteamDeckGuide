# SteamDeckGuide
A wiki to help you make the most of your Steam Deck, powered by TiddlyWiki.

# Contributing
For now, the easiest way for me to allow other to make contribution is for you to edit or upload the files inside the "tiddlers" folder of this github repo. I will review your submission and update the live wiki at https://steamdeckguide.tiddlyhost.com or https://www.telumire.be/SteamDeckGuide (github page).

A neat way to do that is to use the vscode web editor. Simply press `.` to open the editor. In the file explorer (ctrl+shift+e), unfold the "tiddlers" folder, then edit the tiddlers or create your own. To push your changes, go to the Source Control (ctrl+shift+g), set a message and press the checkmark button.

You can also create/edit tiddlers directly at https://steamdeckguide.tiddlyhost.com. To enable the edit options, click on the down arrow in the header, then click on the toggle at the end of the list. This will toggle the edit mode. Create or edit a tiddler, then click on the down arrow of the tiddler and select "export tiddler". Choose the `.tid` format, then you can drag & drop this `.tid` file inside the tiddlers folder on GitHub.

If you have a deep knowledge of GitHub and TiddlyWiki and you have the time to help me set up a more streamlined solution, please feel free to message me, I will gladly accept your help.
