!!!.c Using bottles to add non-steam game

* Download `bottles` from discovery https://usebottles.com/download/
* In order to allow bottles add game to steam, open `Konsole` (<kbd>alt+space</kbd> > `Konsole`) and run <span>
<<copy-code code:"""flatpak override com.usebottles.bottles --filesystem=~/.local/share/Steam""">> <<copy-code code:"""flatpak override com.usebottles.bottles --filesystem=~/.var/app/com.valvesoftware.Steam/data/Steam""">>

You may have permission issue, if so , add sudo before the commands above, if it is the first time to use `sudo`, you also need to set password by running `passwd`
</span>
* Create a new bottle - select `game` as preset
* In the `Details & Utilities`
** click the three dots on the top right, browse files
** drag and drop the folders contain your portable game into the prefix folder if preferred

;Optional

* Go into the settings of your bottle by clicking the arrow —> `Preferences` on the side bar
** feel free to play around settings, but default works for me already
** In system, expand `Components` and you can set your runner etc
** You can install more runners in the main page of the bottles by clicking the three horizontal line and preference
* Go to `Programs` on the side bar
** click <kbd>+</kbd> button to select the exe of your games
** Press the play button to test it is running fine
** Press the <kbd>...</kbd> on the game entry and <kbd>Add to steam</kbd>, you may need to stop/start steam to see the effect.
** You can also add to steam using boilr (see bellow).

!!!.c Using boilr to add custom arts for non-steam game

* Download `boilr` using discovery or from https://github.com/PhilipK/BoilR/releases. <br>If using the executable downloaded from github (said to be more powerful), you need to right click —> `properties` —> `Permissions` —> `Is executable` (toggle), so you can run it.
* Go to the `settings`, add your steamgriddb API to it https://www.steamgriddb.com/profile/preferences/api
* Go into the `Images` side bar and press the button at the bottom to import the game arts <br> If it is not to your liking, you can click the title and hand pick the images yourself later.
* Sometimes there is a boilr bug, where all the images look the same. In this case, open steam and have a look at those non-steam game and close steam and redo boilr typically fix them.

!!!.c (still improving): install games from epic/origin/gog etc

* For epic and gog games, you can use `heroic` launcher which is nice and easy (I've only tested epic games and it works fine)
* However, `bottles` can have more launchers in one place, including EAplay which does not appear to be supported by Lutris.
* Open the bottle (new or existing one), and on the side bar choose `installers`
* Choose the launchers to your liking - I have tried epic, gog, EA, blizzard, and ubisoft - all works
* Install any game from any of the launcher
** To install any game to SD card, you need to grant file system access, use the software `flatseal` from discovery, go to `filesystem` > `Other files` and add `/run/media/{your sd card ID}`. Now when you install any game, you can find the SD card marked as the `E:/` drive.
* ''Note'': In previous versions of Boilr, game installed in bottles didn't play in steam when using the three dots > add to steam. The latest update works perfectly. So stick with that and dont use add to steam from bottles, which has problems.

End result (here displaying some non-steam game + steam games + some apps all having nice cover arts):
