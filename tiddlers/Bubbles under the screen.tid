type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

[[Some users reported|https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/vyg01a/have_the_screen_bubble_problem_on_your_recent_512/]] that the 512GB etched glass screen has a  bubbles issue. [[A common theory|https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/vtug0k/comment/ifaw9ra]] was that the LOCA wasn't applied and cured properly, however a user on reddit had the confirmation from a Valve employee that the issue is NOT adhesive related, [[but is caused by a residue on the surface of the display|https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/wyhw4e/steam_deck_bubble_fix_512_not_adhesive_related/]].
